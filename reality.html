            <em class="date ">16th June, 2020</em>
            <p>Today a person whom I have known is no more. He was just a student among many others in the boy's hostel.
                I just found out today that he committed suicide. He wasn't my friend or classmate, I even doubt we
                hardly have a conversation ever but his demise makes me question myself. This is the 3rd one this year,
                where I knew them personally. It's so odd that they were once breathing & laughing, now they don't even
                exist.
                I don't understand the meaning of it, all of it.
                Among Us, we claim to achieve nirvana, the ultimate enlightenment, and god knows how many different
                things. But you know it's very hard to act upon things you know for sure. I don't know why but I among
                others find it very hard to apply all this wisdom available to us.
                And still the meaning is missing.
                I love to learn about the universe, how things work, how everything happens yet all this information
                seems to hold no value when they are needed. I am constantly oscillating between reality and the idea of
                reality.</p>
